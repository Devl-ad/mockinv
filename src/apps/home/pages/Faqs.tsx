                        As you may know, an investment fund is an institution
                        that collects money from investors to buy assets that
                        will generate a return if their value increases. By
                        investing high amounts of money, an investment fund is
                        able to keep transaction costs low thanks to economies
                        of scale.

                        At Wealthlines we take security very seriously. Because
                        of this we have external parties testing the setup that
                        weâ€™ve created. Internally, we also make use of extensive
                        bug-testing to iron out any flaws. Additionally, all
                        traffic to our servers makes use of extensive encryption
                        making sure no outside parties get their hands on any of
                        your data.

                      <p>
                        All server communication is TLSv1.2 encrypted. So no
                        data falls prey to digital voyeurs.
